# IntroCryptographyDemo
Introduction to cryptography. No coding experience required; introduces students to the accessibility of running code.

## Example Activity:

1. Open a Python editor. Options include:  
	a) Go to this website: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/  
	b) If you have Python installed on your laptop, open a Python editor.  
	c) Google "online Python interpreter" and choose your favorite website.	 
2. Open the `caesar.py` file and copy the code into your editor.
3. Run the code.
4. Enter a message - for example, `HELLO WORLD`.
5. Enter a shift (0-25) - how many places in the alphabet to shift each letter by.
6. The code will output your encrypted message. Congrats! You're ready to share secret messages!
