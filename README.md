# IntroCryptographyDemo
Introduction to cryptography. No coding experience required; introduces students to the accessibility of running code.

## Example Activity:

1. Open a Python editor. Options include:  
	a) Go to this website: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/  
	b) If you have Python installed on your laptop, open a Python editor.  
	c) Google "online Python interpreter" and choose your favorite website.	 
2. Open the `caesar.py` file and copy the code into your editor.
3. Run the code.
4. Enter a message - for example, `HELLO WORLD`.
5. Enter a shift (0-25) - how many places in the alphabet to shift each letter by.
6. The code will output your encrypted message. Congrats! You're ready to share secret messages!

## Codebreaking Challenge
Work together in teams to decrypt 10 secret messages.

#### Allowed resources:
- All provided code and slides (workshop materials: https://github.com/krhablutzel/introcryptographydemo)
- Informational websites on each of these ciphers
Disallowed resources:
- Codebreaking tools with capacity beyond that provided in the workshop materials

You will have a Bank of America volunteer and a SIP TA in your breakout room. They can confirm when your answers are correct, but they are not allowed to give other hints.
